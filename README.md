# Locked Airdrop Python Script

## Run the Script
```
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

```
    python3 main.py
```

### Note:
    - make sure that the `start time` and `end time` are in UNIX TIMESTAMP***
    - add `TOKEN_MINT_ADDRESS`, `_SENDER_WALLET_ADDRESS_PRIVATE_KEY` & `LOCKED_AIRDROP_SECRET_KEY`

### TODO:
For now, script does not have access to Zebec Dashboard so the meta data is not saved. will add the feature shortly. 

#### Happy Coding!!!
